**_Real World Data Analysis completely using Pandas (Best Practices)_**

The pandas library is a powerful tool for multiple phases of the data science workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis.

In this project, we use pandas to extract deeper insights from a real-world dataset. At each stage we have applied the "best practices" for using the pandas library. 

The answers to the follwing questions have been explored using pandas.

- Which talks provoke the most online discussion?
- Visualize the distribution of comments
- Plot the number of talks that took place each year
- What were the "best" events in TED history to attend?
- Unpack the ratings data
- Count the total number of ratings received by each talk
- Which occupations deliver the funniest TED talks on average?
